          Fit Community is a digital fitness start-up designed for people who
          struggle with motivation, time or money. Instead of expensive gym
          memberships, we offer low-cost online classes, flexible on-demand
          workouts and a supportive community that keeps people accountable.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-300">
          Our mission is to make fitness feel less intimidating and more
          inclusive. We focus on beginner-friendly sessions, small achievable
          goals and community-led challenges so that users don’t feel like
          they’re doing it alone.
